# AndroidBasicSamples
All samples where extracted from https://github.com/aporter/coursera-android, witch is agreat material,
but was compatible only with Eclipse, and some projects where outdated. So I updated it, to be easy to use in Android studio. I have more examples that are in the original file that i will put online also.
